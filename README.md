# java-panama-workshop
Welcome to this one day workshop on Java's Project Panama! The goal of the workshop is to help you be proficient with Java's new foreign function and memory access APIs. These APIs are an alternative solution to JNI (Java Native Interface).

Before beginning the workshop and labs be sure to follow the instructions to install the required libraries located in [installs](installs/README.md).

The following are the labs. Answers for lab exercises are in a file called answers.md in each lab directory.
1. [Lab 1](lab1/README.md) - Panama Hello World
2. [Lab 2](lab2/README.md) - Primitives & Arrays
3. [Lab 3](lab3/README.md) - Memory Layouts & C Pointers
4. [Lab 4](lab4/README.md) - Callbacks
5. [Lab 5](lab5/README.md) - Third Party Libraries

Any feedback is always welcome.
